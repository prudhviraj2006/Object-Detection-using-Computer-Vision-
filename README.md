# Object-Detection-using-Computer-Vision-
A Streamlit web app for real-time object detection using Faster R-CNN (ResNet-50 FPN). Upload an image and detect objects with bounding boxes and confidence scores. Built with PyTorch, Torchvision, and Pillow, this project demonstrates deep learningâ€“powered computer vision in an interactive interface.
